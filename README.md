# Elm Launch :rocket:

:construction: This is very much a _Work in Progress_ thingy!

### [Demo](https://elm-launch.firebaseapp.com/)

:warning: This is _NOT_ yet another _webpack-boilerplate-starter-pack-thingy_.
_**A LOT**_ of stuff in here is 100% unnecessary to most Elm projects. Many solutions to non-problems are over-engineered :books: to the point it's not even funny.

I needed a place to experiment :microscope: with a few things, including:

-   trying out a new library I'd like to include in a real project
-   experimenting with new versions of Elm
-   ...or new versions of Elm tools
-   improving my lint/test/build/deploy pipeline for future reference
-   and more...
